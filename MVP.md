# MVP of Early Man

## Map Mode

Map mode is where new enemies and new resources come from. This is where animals to hunt appear, and where other bands appear.
You navigate through the world in this mode. You can access your band information at any time from this mode. 

What makes it cool:
1. Every move is like rolling the dice. New things appear, other things disappear.

2. You can split or merge sub bands in map mode. The player can decide exactly what groupings they would like, and that's
also a gameplay mechanic. How big is the group, and it's a way to kill of a group of undesirables by sending them off into the
wildreness to be attacked by a megalion, and you can watch them get totally pounded. You can also create a harem for one
big tough cave man you want to be father to an army of tough cave people.

## Inspection Mode

OK - so this mode is when we show the whole band at peace. Either gathered around the camp fire, or maybe wondering around in 
a plain. Either way, this is a chance to admire your band, see the pregnant lady, see the little kids running around. This 
mode can be switched to at any time from map mode, and is also pretty much the same thing as the wallpaper mode.

What makes it cool:

1. You can watch love bubbles appear between a man and woman as they select their partner in the band. You can see a bunch of
guys chase after one lady, and she can be into them or not into them. Or she can be into them all and you can guess which one
is the dad.

2. You an watch one guy become the stud and impregnate all the ladies.

3. You can equip weapons, tools, and clothes and you can specify who is carrying what. You can select band members, swap out 
their clothes (or take off all their clothes) and immediately see that change reflected in the world.

4. You distribute food amongst the band and watch them go eat the food? Sure..

5. In inspection mode you can watch a woman give birth, like in Black and White. You can also watch an old or wounded person
die. The whole life cycle happens in inspection mode.

## Combat Mode

Turn based combat mode with bad guys on the left and our guys on the right.

What makes it cool:

1. Characters get bloodied as they fight.
2. Brutal death and attack animations.
3. Big creatures clean house on small men.
4. Loot screen
