# Codename: earlyman

Band management game for Android and iOS set in the Early Years of Man. Small bands rove across the face of a younger Earth
facing ferocious beasts, rival bands, the elements, and even internal disputes. Strive to fashion tools, raise children, write
your people's holy book, honor your ancestors, and survive to continue on your branch of the species.

# Game Modes

## Combat Mode
* turn based, sort of like Final Fantasy or Golden Sun
* characters learn different moves by equipping weapons and gaining combat experience
* combat mode is invoked when bands attack or are attacked, creatures attack or are attacked (hunting)

Moves

The rate of attack is modified by the Agility attribue and the Burden level of the character.

1. Strike - A basic move all characters and creatures have, damage is multiplied by the Strength attribute and by equipping 
blunt weapons like Club.
2. Rend - A basic move all fanged or clawed creatures have, damage is multiplied by the Strength attribute.
3. Pierce - A learned move, damage is multiplied by Strength and Agility. Must have equipped a Spear or thrown item like
a Lance.

## Map Mode

A large component of the game is built around migration and following the herds of animals. Bands must always be on the move
if they wish to eat meat, and the map mode is how you track your location on Earth. As your technology improves you may start
to orient yourself better on the map and be able to find pervious encampments or sources of water.

Until you discover map technology the map is dark except for your current location and as you move away you lose sight of
other points of interest. There is a field of view based on the size of your group in map mode where you can see heards or
water sources or other bands represented as icons on the map. It's from the map mode that you would decide to attack or to
engage in a hunt.

Map mode may also allow you to set your band stance: defensive, migratory, sneak attack. These stances affect what initiative
levels you will have entering into combat mode and may also provide other benefits or liablities. Possibly your line of sight
and range of visible terrain is influcenced by what stance you are in, and what level of wisdom your vangaurd has.

The map is directly overhead, you tap on the screen to set a new destination. While the band is moving you may open stat menus
as overlays because movement is not immediate.

TODO:

1. Should there be waypoints we move between, like FFT? With options to engage or be engaged by neighboring bands. This does
make it neater.

2. What kind of gates are there to stop you from visiting every waypoint? Well.. possibly having enough water and food to make
it between certain nodes.. You might need to discover meat salting before you can take long journeys, and you might need
to have a larger band to cross certain deserts. Or maybe domesticated animals.

3. 


## Camp Mode

In camp mode you see your band gathered around the fire (if you have discovered fire). They mill around and interact with one
another. There are menus on screen that allow you to check on the status of band members. Here you can equip them with new
tools or weapons or clothes. This is also the mode where Shaman may enter into their story telling mode, or other rituals.

Families may start in Camp Mode. Fights may also break out. In your character list you'll see sub groups begin to form. These
might be the warrior group, or the elders, or family units. Bonds between these characters will be stronger, meaning that
they will have improved morale when they are together. Families can't really be assigned, they form on their own. However as
the player you fill the role of the tribal elders, so you can bless some actions and condemn others. For example you can bless
a man and woman coming together and having a child, you can condemn a large male bullying other characters. These blessings 
and condemnations influence the culture of your group.

In camp mode you also set the marching order when migrating. This is important because you may be attacked from behind, or
even from the air randomly. So good plicy to distribute your warriors in the group.

You may split your group in camp mode as well. For example, to create a raiding party of warriors. Though the camp of women
and children who stay behind are now more vulnerable.

# Actions the Player Can Take (And How These May Trigger Game Events)

The player decides who eats what.

The player distributes clothes and tools.

The player issues commands in combat mode. (A character may flee or lose their nerve and act out)

The player may choose to banish characters from the group.

The player may choose to adopt orphaned characters into the group.

The player blesses and condems if they have an elder council.

The player directs the band in map mode.

The player configures burden levels and thus the overall carrying capacity of the group.

# Trade Offs and Play Mechanics:

## Elder Influence and Culture

If your culture level is high characters are much more likely to be swayed by the  elder council's blessings and 
condemnations. For example, you may bless the union between a man and woman, and if the culture  level is they may marry and 
start a family. If your culture level is low they may ignore you, or if very low even choose the opposite of what you bless.

How to build culture:
1. Have a shaman tell stories at the camp fire (perhaps a good story is a minigame? something like connecting stars in 
a constellation?)
2. Have victory in battle.
3. Honor ancestors (proper burials, story telling including the ancestors)
4. Proper blessing and condemnations. Condemn what is wrong. Bless what is good.

How to lose culture:
1. When band members die.
2. Poor blessings and condemnations.
3. When people are unhappy you lose culture.

## Pulling Your Weight

1. Food is scare, and each character in your band requires a certain amount. Weak characters, like children and elders, can't
carry very much, and must be cared for by stronger characters. Children are important though because they are the future
of your band, but if you have too many and they aren't being cared for and they starve you will lose culture. Elders are 
important because they form the elder council. However you only need a few elders for the council, and all characters age.

You may need to banish children and elders from your group.

You may need to banish the wounded or the sick.

You may need to allow a rivalery to end in combat and death to reduce the population, or to resolve and unresolvable anger.

## Breeding - V1

1. You can selectively breed for traits. You can get a strong man and woman together and they'll have strong babies. Strength
and agility make you effective in combat. Intelligence makes you good at crafting tools and discovering technology. Wisdom
makes you more likely to follow the advice of Elders and makes you a cultural generator. However inbreeding is a danger.
Inbreeding will result in weak characters or even deformed characters. So you need to be open to assimilating orphan
characters.

However the greatest treasure of a group are women. They nurture children and a strong woman who can bear many children
is a huge boon for the band and must be protected. Rival bands will try to steal your young women. Internal fights will start
over between men over women. If you have a band of three, two men, and one woman, you're better off letting the men fight it
out over the woman than constantly having a discontented man.

There may be multiple women for one man, but that's not very sustainable because other bands with more men will take the
woman and kill the one man who will be outnumbered. Really you want an even balance. Or you need to keep the men separate
from the women in a hunting and raiding band.

## Technology and Crafting - V2?

Technologies to discover: Fire, Wheel, Atlatale, Bow, Obsedian Blades, Bronze Working

Crafting takes time and requires ingredients from the natural world. Natural materials may be harvested passively if you set
a quota on what you want to collect?

# Early Player Stories

You start out as a young man, possibly just banished from another group. You have a spear, and hide garment, and that's all.

The first thing you'll need to do is hunt for some food. You find a deerodon on a node ahead of you in map mode. 
You engage sneak formation and get close to the deer, close enough to enter combat mode. You get a surprise attack in and 
kill the deer. Battles are usually not very long in combat mode. A strike is often fatal, or at least incapacitating, so 
initiative is very important.

You get lots of meat and a hide from the deer. You enter into camp mode. You don't yet have fire technology, so you knosh
on the raw meat until you can't eat anymore. You then begin crafting the deer hide into an extra garment.

You enter into map mode and look around. Ahead you see another small band, just an old man and a young woman. Excellent. You
want the young woman, and the old man should be no trouble. You attack, and enter into combat mode.

The old man is in front of the woman, who is also in combat mode. You have the initiative. You use "Strike". The old man is 
down, but not dead. The young woman then goes, she has a spear and she stabs you in the side. Very painful. Damn. Your turn 
again. You use  "Disarm" and succeed in getting the spear. The woman uses strike on you, but her strength level is too low 
and you're able to easily block it. Your turn again. You use "Strike" on the woman and she is also down, but not dead.

Now you are back in map mode, and presented with the review screen. In the loot window you see "Woman" and "Man" as well as
"Spear" and the clothing the woman was wearing. The old man wasn't wearing more than a loin cloth. You want to adopt the woman
into your group, and of course you want the spear. You're not sure what to do with the old man. You could use him to carry 
things, or as bait for a wild animal, he doesn't need to eat much.. but his culture influence is strong, and if he stays 
around the woman will be slower to gain your culture. So you can either execute him, or just leave him alone in the wild. You 
leave him alone in the wild unconcious. He'll probably be dead by nightfall anyway.

The woman is still unconcious so you add her to your burden, and move on. You notice your strength level is modified
temporarily by your wound. You also see you gained some combat experience, boosting your Agility.

...

You and the woman form a family unit, and she becomes pregnant. Your band movement speed is reduced, as is her agility.

...

The child is born, but the mother dies in child birth. The child dies shortly after because you have no way to feed it.

...

[Hmmm... the game would be designed to make it very difficult to survive alone and to bootstrap a band. Maybe you start with
a larger band? But bootstrapping it would be fun, even if it is difficult.]

...

You find another larger band. This one is too large to attack, but they don't see you because you are just one in sneak
mode. You could attempt to sneak into their camp and steal a woman.. You do this successfully because of your high level of
agility. The woman is stolen away without alarming the whole camp. [What does this look like in the game?]

....

You have formed a band of four young men. Because none of you have a strong culture, and because there is enough food, and
no females to argue over, there is peace in the group. The largest male has established himself as the band leader. [So there
is a leader system? How does that work? Is it needed?]

The band comes across another band, this one has two men and two women. Your band kills the two men, though one of your band
is seriously wounded in the process and dies shortly after. Now you have three men and two women.

You're not sure what to do. There is no conflict yet, and you don't want to banish the weakest man because he is still useful
to the band, but you don't want him sneakily breeding with one of the women. [Do we allow castration?]

...




### Questions

1. Is there a night and day cycle? No.. that would sort of mess with the time scale I'd like to use where children grow up
into adults in about one hour of game play.

2. Do you "find shelter".. maybe.. a good shelter might increase incentive to improve your map technology.

3. How many "turns" would it take to bring around the woman after capturing her?

4. How should we handle the stab wound you took attacking the woman?
