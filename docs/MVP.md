# MVP of Early Man

## Map Mode

Map mode is where new parties surface on the game board. This is where huntable animals appear, and where other bands appear.
You navigate through the world in this mode. Movement is turn based.

What makes it cool:
1. Every move is like rolling the dice. New things appear, other things disappear.

2. You can split or merge sub bands in map mode. The player can decide exactly what groupings they would like, and that's
also a gameplay mechanic. How big is the group, and it's a way to kill off a group of undesirables by sending them off into 
the wildreness to be attacked by a megalion, and you can watch them get totally pounded. You can also create a harem for one
big tough cave man you want to be father to an army of tough cave people. How you carve up your bands in a major source of
creative freedom when combined with how the A.I. naturally interacts.

User controls:

1. Tap the screen to select a destination. You can skip your move to stay where you are.
2. You can enter into inspection mode at any time on your turn before your move.
3. If you end your move on a node where another party also has moved or has stayed and they are hostile you'll enter into
combat mode. If the party is not hostile you have the option to merge.

## Inspection Mode

This mode is when we show the whole band hanging out. Either gathered around the camp fire, or maybe wondering around in 
a plain. Either way, this is a chance to admire your band, see the pregnant lady, see the little kids running around, see the
injured people, the huge battle scarred warriors. This  mode can be switched to at any time from map mode, and is also pretty
much the same thing as the wallpaper mode except you can't select characters in wallpaper mode.

What makes it cool:

1. You can watch love bubbles appear between a man and woman as they select their partner in the band. You can see a bunch of
guys chase after one lady, and she can be into them or not into them. Or she can be into them all and you can guess which one
is the dad.

2. You an watch one guy become the stud and impregnate all the ladies.

3. You can equip weapons, tools, and clothes and you can specify who is carrying what. You can select band members, swap out 
their clothes (or take off all their clothes) and immediately see that change reflected in the world.

4. You distribute food amongst the band and watch them go eat the food? Sure..

5. In inspection mode you can watch a woman give birth, like in Black and White. You can also watch an old or wounded person
die. The whole life cycle happens in inspection mode.

User controls:

1. Select characters by tapping them. This will show the character's name above their head and raise a details pane. The 
details pane will show the characters vital stats.

2. In the details pane you can equip weapons and clothing from the band inventory.

## Combat Mode

Turn based combat mode with bad guys on the left and our guys on the right.

What makes it cool:

1. Characters get bloodied as they fight.
2. Brutal death and attack animations.
3. Big creatures clean house on small men.
4. Loot screen is fun, and a trade off because you can only carry so much.

User controls:

1. Each character in the battle will attack based on their initiative/agility.
2. You select one attack (Strike, Stab, etc) and a target. Once you select the move, you select a target, and then the move is
executed.
3. Once either side is entirely KOed the remaining side wins. The winning side selects loot from the defeated side. If the
player is defeated by a wild carniverous animal, the animal will take the corpse or KO body of one of your combatants. If the
player is defeated by a hostile band the AI will decide whether to execute, enslave, or leave each of your combatants.
4. If the player wins against an animal, he may take meat and hide. If the player wins against an band he may execute,
enslave, or just leave surviving KOs.
